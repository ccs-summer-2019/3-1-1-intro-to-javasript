## JavaScript Comments

A comment is ignored by the JS engine

* demonstrate a single line comment
* demonstrate a multiple line comment

A JavaScript program is one or more JS statements. Like a sentence, a statement is one coherent "thought" or instruction.

* It should appear on its own line
* It should end with a semicolon (a semicolon means "this instruction is over, move to the next one.")

## JavaScript Built-in Data Structures

Six data types that are primitives:

* boolean
  * true; false; 10 > 5;
  * undefined >> false
  * null >> false
  * boolean >> true is true, false is false
  * number >> +0, -0, NaN is false otherwise true
  * string >> "" (it's length is 0) is false otherwise true
  * object >> true
* null
  * represents an object that is not defined
  * you can empty an object by setting it to null (the value is null, but type is still an object)
  * typeof null is object
* undefined
  * represents a value that is not defined
  * You can empty an object by setting it to undefined (both value and type is undefined)
  * typeof undefined is undefined
* number
  * 1; 3.14; -20; 4.5e7;
  * 64-bit floating number https://floating-point-gui.de/basic/
  * typeof +Infinity is number
  * typeof -Infinity is number
  * typeof NaN is number
* string
  * 'Cool'; "Cool"; "That was 'cool'"; "That was \"cool\"";
* symbol
  * Symbols do not have a literal syntax (e.g how Strings have '')
  * A Symbol is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property

Anything that doesnâ€™t belong to any of these six primitive types is considered an object: {}; function object; array object

## JavaScript Values

NaN represents a Number that doesn't make sense, e.g. 0 / 0

## Variables

A variable is like a name badge, in that it doesn't contain anything, but is a name or label for a value.

Declare a variable:

  var age;

Assign a value to a variable

  age = 52;

A single equal sign is the "assignment operator".

Shorthand:

  var age = 52;

Declare multiple variables:

  var age, favoriteColor, name;

Declare and assign multiple variables:

  var age = 37, favoriteColor = "green", name = "Jake";

Variable naming:

* First character a-z, A-Z, $, _
* Variables starting with $ are often used for DOM objects
* Variables starting with _ are often used for things that are not meant to be used by the developer
  * underscore convention is a pretty good convention to use for things that are sort of private, but that you don't actually need to hide
  * frequently used to preface a name of an object's property or method that is private
  * standard way to indicate an unused function argument
* The other characters can be letters, $, _ , numbers
* They are case sensitive
* The convention, but not rule, is to capitalize each word after the first

* var
  * Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
* let
  * Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
  * Example https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let
  * not subject to Variable Hoisting
* const
  * Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant
  * not subject to Variable Hoisting

variables are not tied to a type; a variable can be assigned and reassigned data of any type

## Expressions

An expression is code that evaluates to a value.

// a value is an expression
'cool' // => 'cool'

// a variable is an expression
a // => 'cool'

// a variable declaration is an expression
var c = 'another thing'; // => undefined

// a variable assignment is an expression
c = 'a third thing'; // => the rhs of the assignment, i.e. 'a third thing'

Mostly everything in JS is an expression / has a value.

## Operators

Operators act on values to produce new values. The value and side effects differ for each operator.

Arithmetic
  * +, -, * , /

Comparison

  * ==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=
  * LOOSE (THEY COERCE THE TYPE)
  * STRICT (DO NOT COERCE THE TYPE)

Logical

  * Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values. When they are, they return a Boolean value.
  * logical NOT (!), logical OR (||), logical AND (&&)

  * !true // => false
  * !(10 > 5) // => false

  * true && true // => true
  * true && false // => false
  * (10 > 5) && (10 < 100) // => true
  * (10 > 5) && (10 < 10) // => false

  * true || true // => true
  * true || false // => true
  * false || false // => false
  * (10 > 5) || (10 < 100) // => true
  * (10 > 5) || (10 < 10) // => true

## Functions

A function is a group of statements that can be called multiple times, and can be stored in a variable or passed around.

To put it another way: A function is an object that contains JavaScript code that is run when I call the function.

Functions have ...

* Zero or more explicit parameters (A parameter is a variable in a method definition)
* Zero or more arguments (the arguments are the data you pass into the method's parameters)
* Two implicit parameters (this, arguments)
* Zero or more side effects
* Exactly one return value, undefined by default (ending a function with return; will return undefined)

Function declaration

A function declaration is a complete statement that can stand on its own. It creates a function with the name you specify.

A function declaration consists of ...

* function keyword
* function name
* parameter list
* function body

function functionName(firstParameter) {
  // body
}

// Outputs: "Yes!"
isItHoisted();

function isItHoisted() {
    console.log("Yes!");
}

Function expression

A function expression cannot stand on its own, but we can assign it to a variable or pass it to another function. It's not a statement, it's an expression, so it must be used as part of a statement.

var aFunction = function(thing) {
  alert(thing);
}

document.getElementById(id).addEventListener('click', function(){
  alert("Hey");
});

// Immediately Invoked Function Expression
(function(){

})();

Scope

* Lexical (top to bottom)
* Variable declarations (var) are hoisted to the top of their function, assignments are not
* Function declarations are hoisted in their entirety

## Control Flow

if...else

An if...else statement is one of the primary ways that you can control the flow of a JavaScript program (the other primary way is using functions).

if(something truthy){
  do something
} else {
  do something else
}

switch

switch can be used to handle multiple scenarios for a single variable

var name = "Mady";

switch(name) {
  case "Mady":
    console.log("Hi, Mady!");
    break;
  case "Joey":
    console.log("Are you a human or a dog?");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("I don't know you.");
}

for loops

In class, we will almost exclusively use iteration functions, but it's important to know what a for loop is.

for(var i = 0; i < 5; i++){
  console.log(i);
}

compare to a while loop

var i = 10;
while(i > 0) {
  console.log(i)
  i--
}

## Linking JS

* Name the file with the extension .js. (e.g. app.js)
* Write the relative path to your JS file in a <script> tag right before the closing tag of the body. <script src="app.js"></script> </body>

## Timers

It is possible to do things over time with JavaScript. To do something just once, later, use setTimeout. To do something over and over use setInterval.

* setTimeout(function, ms)

This means that the function should be run no less than, but possibly greater than x milliseconds from now (1000ms = 1s):

setTimeout(function() {
  alert("Your banking session has ended for your security. :)");
}, 36000);

* setInterval(function, ms)

This means that this function will be repeated every 'x' milliseconds.
Use clearInterval to stop the call.

var everySecond = setInterval(function() {
  document.querySelector('.time').textContent = Date.now();
}, 36000); // this will fire; you do not call everySecond();

clearInterval(everySecond) // when you want to cancel it
